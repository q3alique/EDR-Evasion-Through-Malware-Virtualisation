# EDR-Evasion-Through-Malware-Virtualisation
Reverse shell implant using full API emulation and virtualization for advanced EDR evasion. By abstracting execution and simulating system API calls inside a virtual machine, the implant bypasses traditional detection methods. Ideal for studying modern evasion techniques in red teaming and malware research.
